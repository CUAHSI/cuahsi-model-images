# Basic R Singleuser Image

This is the basic singleuser image for computing using the R programming language in the CUAHSI JupyterHub platform. The purpose of this image is to provide a general purpose computing environment that's derived from the cuahsi/singleuser-base image and includes several useful R libraries for working with HydroShare data. Below are the primary tools and libraries included in this environment:

1. `dataRetrieval`: Retrieval Functions for USGS and EPA Hydrologic and Water Quality Data - [cran package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataRetrieval/index.html)
2. `WaterML`: Fetch and Analyze Data from 'WaterML' and 'WaterOneFlow' Web Services - [cran package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WaterML/index.html)
